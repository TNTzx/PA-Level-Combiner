PA Level Combiner

Instructions:
1. Convert all levels to the specified level format version in the program..
   This can be done by simply saving the levels in this version of Project Arrhythmia.
2. Select levels to the list.
3. Save output level.
4. Choose the items you want to combine using the "Advanced" button.
   If unchecked, the output will only get the attribute from the first level
   (for example, if "markers" is unchecked, only the markers
   from the first level would be copied to the second).
4. Press the combine button!

Make sure you've done the following:
- Have all the themes in both levels in your themes folder.
- Delete objects on the second level that you don't want to be duplicated.
- Both levels must have the same music.
