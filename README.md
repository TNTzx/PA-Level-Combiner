# PA Level Combiner

A program that combines two levels of the same song into one.
Used to make collaborations easier by allowing collab members to work on their parts individually instead of passing files around.

## False positive detection! >:(
Some antiviruses might detect the .exe as malicious, but I can guarantee you 100% undeniably and certainly that releases will never ever contain viruses!
The packager I'm using to convert my scripts into a .exe seems to have this problem. I tried switching to others but to no avail, some even raising the number of false positives.

## How it's used:

Sometimes, parts of a level are split in different levels. This program combines those levels to get a level with all the parts in it.


## Instructions:
1. Convert all levels to the specified level format version in the program.
   This can be done by simply saving the levels in this version of Project Arrhythmia.
2. Select levels to the list.
3. Save output level.
4. Choose the items you want to combine using the "Advanced" button.
   For example, if "markers" is unchecked, the markers won't be added to the output.
4. Press the combine button!

### Make sure you've done the following:
- Have all the themes in the levels in your themes folder.
- Delete objects on the other levels that you don't want to be duplicated.
- Both levels must have the same music.
